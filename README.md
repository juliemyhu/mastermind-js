### Thought process

# Why no fancy technology ?

When I first received this challenge, I immediately thought about which techstack to use. A few options from that came to mind were Pygame/python, react with React-app, or vanilla Javascript. I already made projects in pygame and react app, so I decided to go with the vanilla Javascript option because I thought I would learn the most and still be able to complete the project in the timeframe given.

Prior to working on this project, I was following a JS 30 day course and taking a Object Oriented Programming Javascript course. I was not comfortable with my Javascript skills at the time, so naturally I thought this would be the perfect time to practice some things I have been learning recently.

The database is the localStorage browser.
