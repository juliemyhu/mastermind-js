# Mastermind JS

Mastermind JS is a code breaking game based off the board game Mastermind. The same rules apply - there is a 4 code combination that we need to break. The only difference from the actual game is that we're using numbers instead of colors and pegs. Read more about Mastermind here: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)

### Thought process

Why did I not use a front end framework ? When I first received this challenge, I immediately thought about which techstack to use. A few options that came to mind were Pygame/python, react with React-app, or vanilla Javascript. I already made projects in pygame and react app, so I decided to go with the vanilla Javascript option because I thought I would learn the most and still be able to complete the project in the timeframe given.

Prior to working on this project, I was following a [JS 30 day](https://javascript30.com/) course and taking a [Object Oriented Programming Javascript course](https://www.educative.io/courses/learn-object-oriented-programming-in-javascript). I was not comfortable with my Javascript skills at the time, so I was taking some courses and watching JS tutorials. Naturally I thought this would be the perfect time to practice what I've been learning.
